1. It's a course design of Digit Logic in HUST.
2. the project is to create a washing machine.
3. I use synchronous timing logic to write it. 
4. Think twice if you try to use asynchronous timing logic.
5. I added the additional order functions, it means you can choose a time tocount down, what's more,I add a clean key used to zero clearing order time when the machine is running countdown.
6. It's the final version,and I'll stop to maintain the project.If you have any questions,"YOU CAN SOLVE IT BY YOURSELF"
